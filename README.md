This repository contains programs that were helpful in the composition of a paper "Sherlock Holmes and the Unbreakable Cipher" submitted ot the Speckled Band of Boston chapter of Baker Street Irregulars.  The paper consists of a recollection of previously undiscovered notes by JOhn Watson in which Sherlock steps him through the use of the Vigenere cipher.  The code was intended to simulate computations that could (and in Victorian times presumably would) have been accomplished by hand.  There is an additional directory which contains Wolfram Language code for a notebook that was used in preparing a number of slides used in the accompanying presentation.
